FreeTube is supported by the [Privacy Redirect](https://github.com/SimonBrazell/privacy-redirect) and [LibRedirect](https://github.com/libredirect/libredirect) extensions, which will allow you to open YouTube links into FreeTube. You must enable the option within the advanced settings of the extension for it to work.

- Download Privacy Redirect for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-redirect/) or [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/privacy-redirect/pmcmeagblkinmogikoikkdjiligflglb).

- Download LibRedirect for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/libredirect/) or [Google Chrome](https://libredirect.github.io/download_chromium.html).

If you have issues with the extension working with FreeTube, please create an issue in the [FreeTube Repository](https://github.com/FreeTubeApp/FreeTube) instead of the extension repository. Most if not all problems is a problem with FreeTube itself and not a problem with the extension.

**This extension does not work on Linux portable builds!**
