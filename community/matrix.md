Those in the FreeTube community are invited to come and join our Matrix chatroom.

[Matrix](https://matrix.org/) is an open protocol for secure and decentralized communication. Matrix is similar to an IRC chatroom but also includes features like avatars, images, and end-to-end encryption. Email is optional when registering.

In the same way as there are several different web browsers that can access the web, there are also [several different applications](https://matrix.org/clients/) that can access Matrix.

The official application is Element, which runs on pretty much all computers, phones, and web browsers. You can download Element either [from its website](https://element.io/), [or on F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/im.vector.app/), or possibly also `element-desktop` from your system's package manager.

Once you have an account, you can [join the chatroom here.](https://matrix.to/#/#freetube:matrix.org?via=matrix.org&via=privacytools.io&via=tchncs.de)

## Notes

- Please help others out if you're able to. Unfortunately we do not have time to always answer someone's question(s).
- Please don't beg to become a moderator. That's a good way a ruining your chances of us picking you.
- If you become a moderator and complaints rise about abuse of moderation, we will revoke your moderator status.
- Please follow the rules.

## Rules

- We can change and edit these rules as we need to.
- English only please. It is harder to communicate with others when a language barrier is in effect.
- Please keep the discussion related to FreeTube. General privacy discussion is also okay, but if it starts to become a heated debate, consider continuing the debate in a different chatroom for the sake of the other users.
- Do not ask for anyone's personal information. This is a privacy focused community and we should respect each other's privacy.
- Please act appropriately. We'd rather not write out a large list of do's and don'ts. You should know what that includes. If another user asks you to stop doing something, you should stop.
- If you are ever unsure of something, feel free to PM one of the members of the team.
