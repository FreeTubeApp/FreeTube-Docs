## Welcome to the FreeTube community!

Welcome to the FreeTube community! First of all, we want to say thank you for getting involved in the project!

On this page, we want to give you some guidlines on how to behave when contributing to or interacitng with the FreeTube project, its maintainers and the community around it.

## Rules

- We can change and edit these rules as we need to.
- English only please. It is harder to communicate with others when a language barrier is in effect.
- Keep in mind that we are a FLOSS and volunteer-led project. All development in the FreeTube project is being done voluntarily and in the spare time of the contributors. Show respect for their work and please refrain from asking when a feature will be implemented or a bug fixed. As a FLOSS project it is impossible for us to provide detailed timelines and we won't make any promises we can't keep.
- Please act appropriately. Should you really be unsure what this means, [GitHub's community guidlines](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines) might help you.
- Do not use AI/LLMs to create issues, pull requests, comments or any other content you submit to the FreeTube project. It is okay to have a LLM give you feedback on your work and help you improve it, but we will not accept any contributions where LLMs did most of the work.
- If you are ever unsure of something, feel free to contact one of the members of the team via the [Matrix chatroom](matrix.md).


## Moderation policy

Should you break the rules outlined above, for example by insulting others in the FreeTube community or by spamming issues, we will take appropriate moderation steps.

First, you will receive a written warning from a member of the FreeTube team. They will ask you to stop doing what you are doing and refrain from doing it again in the future. They might also delete the content for which you received the warning.

Should you continue your behavior or misbehave in any other way, there will not be a second warning. We will ban you from contributing to the FreeTube project in the future.

Please note that it is impossible to apply this policy to every single case. Moderators might decide that they need to take a more strict approach, for example when someone is spamming comments on GitHub, which might lead to a direct ban without prior warning.
